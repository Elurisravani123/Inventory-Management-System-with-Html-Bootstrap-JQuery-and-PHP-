# Inventory-Management-System-with-Html-Bootstrap-and-PHP-

This is a Inventory management system built with PHP language. In the fornt-end I have used HTML and Bootstrap. In the back-end I have used PHP as a server site language. Also for retrive data from the HTML pages i have used JQUERY.This software is free anyone can work on this and can take it. The code is documented properly for understanding.
